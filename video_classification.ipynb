    "Video classification is one of the many tasks in the field of _video understanding_, technologies that automatically extract information from video. You can read more about the great, wide world of video understanding in our blog post [An Introduction to Video Understanding: Capabilities and Applications](https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2021/12/14/an-introduction-to-video-understanding-capabilities-and-applications.html).\n",

    "- Setting up: Installation of the necessary packages, including Tensorflow, and importing the relevant libraries.\n",
    "- The Data: An exploration of the [Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) for action recognition.\n",
    "- The Model: Experimentation with a pretrained version of the [I3D video classification model](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/i3d-model) for action recognition, hosted on the Tensorflow Model Hub."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we make use of the DeepMind [Kinetics dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06950), which consists of thousands of YouTube videos focused on human actions and interactions. While there are several versions of this dataset, we'll focus primarily on the Kinetics 400 dataset which contains 400 human action classes, ranging from human-object interactions like playing instruments, as well as human-human interactions like shaking hands. Each video clip is approximately ten seconds and has been sourced from a unique YouTube video.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As of November 2021, the video files that make up the Kinetics datasets are stored at https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinetics/ as described in this [repository](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset). The Kinetics 400 contains a total of 306,245 video clips with at least 400 clips in each class.  These are distributed among three splits: training, test and validation. Each split consists of thousands of videos in `.mp4` format. \n",

    "For each dataset split, videos are grouped into a series of directories and each directory is packaged as a `tar.gz` file that needs to be unpacked. Each of these `tar.gz` files contains about 1000 video clips.  In this notebook we'll explore a handful of videos from the validation set and we created a `KineticsLoader` class to handle downloading and unpacking these video files.  While this class is designed to handle the full validation (or test, or train) set, we can also use it to explore a small portion of the videos, which we'll demonstrate in the following cells. "

    "As we can see, there's quite a bit of variation among our video batch that isn't really detectable when we viewed the raw video clips earlier. While each video is exactly 10 seconds long, some have 300 frames and others have only 127 frames. Some have small spatial dimensions (240 x 320) while others are quite large (720 x 1280). The only thing common to all videos is that they each have three color channels, the familiar RGB system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has implications for how we sample and process these video clips for model consumption. The model we'll use in this notebook requires spatial dimensions of (224 x 224) so we'll need to resize and crop each frame of each video to these dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we deal with the temporal dimension, i.e., the number of frames?  That depends on how we want to use our video classification model. The model has no specified limit on the number of frames it can accept (note, however, that more frames translates to longer processing time which can become very computationally expensive!) If we only send to the model one video clip at a time, we can feed it the full number of frames for inference. However, it's usually faster to send a batch to the model rather than sending each video separately. In that case, we need to deal with the variation in frame rates for these videos because we cannot create a numpy array in which one of the dimesions varies!  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Video Resampling\n",
    "The crux of the issue lies in the fact that different cameras have different frame capture rates. Higher quality videos have more frames-per-second (FPS) than lower quality videos leading to a situation in which a collection of 10 second videos can nevertheles have different numbers of frames. Below we show a toy example of two videos that are each 10 seconds long but the top fewer frames than the bottom one over that time span due to having a lower FPS.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![Upsampling](images/video_fps_example.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a batch of video clips, we must resample the clips so that each has the same number of frames.  This can be accomplished either by _upsampling_ videos with low FPS, or _downsampling_ videos with high FPS.  A simple way to perform upsampling is to duplicate certain frames throughout the length of the video. In the figure below, we see Video 1 has frames added to match the number of frames contained in Video 2.  These frames are duplicates of existing frames in Video 1 (which is why some of the frames are repeated colors). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/upsample.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, downsampling involves removing frames periodically throughout the video. This time, we remove a sample of unique frames from Video 2 so that it has the same number of frames as Video 1. \n",
    "<img src = \"images/downsample.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, resampling should be done in such a way that the frames we duplicate or remove are equally dispersed throughout the duration of the 10 second clip in order to capture as much of the original motion as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a pinch we could simply grab a fixed-size chunk of consecutive frames (from the beginning, middle, or end) from each video clip. The problem here is that this chunk may only represent a portion of the full 10 second interval. The model would then attempt to infer on a batch of videos in which one of them has frames representing close to the full 10 seconds, while another has frames representing only a fraction of the time. This could increase the difficulty of the model to properly classify the latter video.  "

    "\n",
    "1. First, a central square proportional to the size of the video is cropped\n",
    "2. The cropped portion is resized to 224x224 pixels\n",

    "In this notebook we make use of the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) video classification model. This model architecture was introduced in 2017 and provided state-of-the-art results for video action classification for multiple datasets. You can read more about this model in the original paper, [Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's inception, there are now multiple pre-trained versions of the I3D model that are publicly available on the [TensorFlow Model Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub). The original version was pre-trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset, which we explored above. Another version was trained on the Kinetics 600 dataset. We created an `I3DLoader` class to handle model loading from the TF Model Hub. You can choose either the `kinetics-400` or `kinetics-600` version. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between these two models is in the number of classes they predict. I3D trained on Kinetics 400 predicts, you guessed it, 400 different classes, while it's counterpart (I3D trained on Kinetics 600) predicts on 600 classes. While we didn't discuss the Kinetics 600 dataset in detail, it is essentially a superset of the Kinetics 400 dataset -- it includes all 400 labels from that dataset, plus an additional 200 unique classes. Either can be used to make inference on our sample of videos but keep in mind that with more classes comes more challenges in predicting the correct class -- there are simply more options for the model to choose from. \n",

    "## Evaluating the model\n",
    "So how well did our model do?  It may seem natural to consider the model's accuracy using only it's top prediction for each video and we'll look at that first. However, when working with hundreds of classes, subtlties arise. For example, some classes could be easily confused -- \"catching or throwing a softball\" and \"catching or throwing a baseball\" are both classes but it may be difficult for the model to discern the type of ball in a low quality video or if the ball only takes up a small handful of pixels in a wide-shot video.  Additionaly, videos can contain more than one action -- \"texting\" while \"driving a car\" (don't do that!) or \"hula hooping\" while \"playing ukulele\". The Kinetics 400 dataset only provides a single ground-truth label for each video, rather than an exhaustive list of annotations. For this reason, the authors recommend evaluating model performance on the top-5 accuracy, rather than top-1. "

    "## Evaluating over many videos\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, everything we've done has been to explore the capability of video classification with a small, concrete example. However, in practice, there are several models and many datasets that one might consider when building a real-world video classification application. In that case, one will need to evaluate dfferent models over various datasets in order to gauge which is most appropriate for the application in question. This is a model benchmarking job. To that end, we've created some additional utilities to facilitate model evaluation over a much larger portion of the Kinetics datasets. Included in this AMP is a benchmarking script that can be automated via the CML Jobs abstraction (or by a simple bash script, if that's your style). Here we provide a quick example of the core utilities contained within that script -- namely, the ability to load, pre-process, and batch over a larger portion of videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "We break this task into two parts: load and cache videos, and evaluation. The first step is performed by our `KineticsLoader` class, and does essentially the same steps as our `load_videos` function above. Specifically, this will load the raw `mp4` format into numpy arrays and perform essential pre-processing, such as cropping and resizing to I3D specifications. Once loaded, these video examples are cached (saved to disk) in their numpy format so that they can be reused in any downstream evaluation process. "
